#### Exporting quizzes into *.docx documents missing text

Export quiz to word docx in Quobject Explorer macos & windows - missing text when opening in Pages, Google docs, libreoffice. 

All created *.docx documents can currently only be opened in MS Word. 

Getting it working with Pages can be done by opening document in Microsoft Word and then Save As, and unchecking "Maintain compatibility with previous versions of Word".

The saved document can then be opened in Pages, Google docs, libreoffice... and all text will be visible
